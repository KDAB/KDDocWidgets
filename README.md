# KDDockWidgets


> ⚠️⚠️: master has been discontinued to reduce confusion, as we now have two lines of development.
> KDDW is being redesigned to allow to support multiple "frontends" (QtWidgets, QtQuick and even non-Qt technologies, like flutter).
> We call this redesign 2.0 and it will be released in 2023.
> 1.x will be supported for many years to come, at least for bug fixes and small features.
> Use v1.5.0 tag for the latest stable. v1.6.0 will be released soon, so branch 1.6 is also safe.
> Use 2.0 if you need non-QtWidgets support, for example QtQuick/QML. While 1.6 has support for QtQuick/QML it won't be receiving
> bug fixes.

Please use 1.6 branch instead.
